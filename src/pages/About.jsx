Hi! I’m Alan, an aspiring Web Developer and UI/UX Designer passionate about creating intuitive, visually appealing web experiences. While I’m still building hands-on development experience, I’ve gained valuable IT and technical skills as the sole IT intern at Omnia Brasil, handling tasks like network support, process automation, and employee training. I also have experience in the public sector at Leme City Hall, supporting systems and IT assets.<br/><br/>
I’m in my third year of a Bachelor’s in Information Systems at FHO (Uniararas), and I speak fluent English and basic Japanese. I’m eager to grow professionally in frontend development and UI/UX design, applying my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to deliver practical solutions.<br/><br/>
Even without extensive professional development experience, I’m motivated to take on challenges, learn quickly, and make an impact through my work.</p>      </div>
